You're not changing the existing string or integer — you're actually creating a new one and re-assigning the variable.

🔍 Let's Explain With an Example
 
str1 = "hello"
str1 = "hi"
The first line creates a string object "hello" and str1 points to it.

The second line creates a new string object "hi" and now str1 points to the new one.

The old "hello" string still exists in memory (unless garbage collected).

Same for integers:
 
a = 10
a = 100
10 is an immutable int object

a = 100 makes a point to a new int object
